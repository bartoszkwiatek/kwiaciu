# Thank you for taking your time to come here!

My name is Bartosz Kwiatek, I've decided to become a front end developer some time ago and currently I am looking for first job on that position.

For now, my preferred solution is React. It felt more comfortable for me as a beginner, and I spent more time with it. 
Lately I am focusing more on Angular, since I want to learn both at similar level before decide which way to go.
